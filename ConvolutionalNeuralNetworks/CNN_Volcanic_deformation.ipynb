Specific deformation patterns are associated with different types of sources of deformation (volcanic activity). A trained person can, by eye, identify the source and location of deformation.

    "**Convolutional Neural Networks** (CCNs) are a popular variant of neural networks used for image classification. CNNs do not require as many weights as a normal neural network, they use the fact that each pixels neighbour provides some context to allow for localised features to be detected. CNN's use [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) to create a set of filters for each layer to create an output image by convolving a set of filters with the input image to create an output volume.\n",

This process can be shortened by re-using model weights from pre-trained models that were developed for standard computer vision benchmark datasets. i.e. some layers of a model trained on one problem that is similar to the actual problem that you're interested in can be used as a shortcut in training your model.  \n",
