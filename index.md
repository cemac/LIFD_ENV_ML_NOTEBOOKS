Leeds Institute for Fluid Dynamics (LIFD) has teamed up with the Center for Environmental Modelling and Computation (CEMAC) team to create 4 Jupyter notebook tutorials on the following topics.

1. [Convolutional Neural Networks](#Convolutional-Neural-Networks)
2. [Physics Informed Neural Networks](#Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks)
3. [Gaussian Processes](#Gaussian-Processes)
4. [Random Forests](#Random-Forests)

These notebooks require very little previous knowledge on a topic and will include links to further reading where necessary. Each Notebook should take about 2 hours to run through and should run out of the box home installations of Jupyter notebooks

## How to Run

These notebooks can run with the resources provided and the anaconda environment setup. If you are familiar with anaconda, juyter notebooks and GitHub. Simply clone this repository and run with in your Jupyter Notebook setup. Otherwise please read the [how to run](howtorun.md) guide.

# Convolutional Neural Networks
### Classifying Volcanic Deformation

# Physics Informed Neural Networks
### 1D Heat Equation and Navier Stokes Equation ###

# Gaussian Processes
### Exploring sea level change via Gaussian processes

# Random Forests
### Identifying controls on leaf temperature via random forest feature importance

## Contributions

We hope that this resource can be built upon to provide a wealth of training material for Earth Science Machine Learning topics at Leeds
